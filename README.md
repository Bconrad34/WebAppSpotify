# WebAppSpotify
## Purpose
This project contains code for a Spotify Listening Room web-app. This project was created following lessons by Tech with Tim on Youtube.
The purpose of this project is to learn and gain experience creating a full-stack web-app from scratch.

## Notice 
While I created this project, Tech with Tim was used as a reference for this code. I do not take credit for all of the code in this project.
